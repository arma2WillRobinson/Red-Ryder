instructions:

place "redryder" file in P:\ directory

set Addon prefix path to z\addons\redryder in BinPBO options

use P:\redryder as Addon source directory and P:\ as Destination directory then pack

place created redryder.pbo in \Steam\SteamApps\common\Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead\@DayZ_Epoch\addons and also in the @Dayz_Epoch\addons of your server folder if you use a separate folder

open your server's mission.sqm and declare "redryder" under addOns[]=

Thats it, ready to launch server and game. It may be useful while testing to add "RedRyder" and "350Rnd_BB_Magazine" to your server's default spawn loadout.
The redryder.pbo in the PBO folder can also be used if you dont want to pack the redryder folder yourself.
